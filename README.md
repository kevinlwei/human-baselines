## Executive Summary

This paper finds that existing human baselines are neither sufficiently rigorous nor transparent to enable meaningful comparisons of human vs. AI performance. We provide recommendations and a reporting checklist to increase rigor and transparency in human baselines. 

Human baselines are reference sets of metrics intended to represent human performance on specific tasks. They are used in AI evaluations to compare human vs. AI performance on evaluation items, adding important context to results and helping inform stakeholders in the broader AI ecosystem (e.g., downstream users, policymakers). 

Specifically, this paper makes three contributions:

1. **Methodological recommendations**  
   Based on a meta-review of the measurement theory and AI evaluation literatures, we provide methodological recommendations for evaluators to build rigorous human baselines in AI evaluations. See the summary in [Summary of Methodological Recommendations for Human Baselines](#summary-of-methodological-recommendations-for-human-baselines).

2. **Reporting checklist**  
   We provide a reporting checklist for evaluators to increase transparency when publishing human baselines. See `/reporting_checklist/`.

3. **Literature review**  
   We review 115 human baselines (studies) to identify methodological gaps in existing AI evaluations, and we find substantial shortcomings in the rigor and transparency of existing human baselines.

Maximal rigor may not be possible in all human baselines due to resource limitations. In these cases, we hope to help researchers make informed tradeoffs, discuss/acknowledge methodological limitations, narrow interpretation of results, and transparently report methods and results. 

## Stages of the Human Baseline Lifecycle

| **Human Baseline Stage**         | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Baseline Design & Implementation | Baseline design is the initial stage of human baseline development, at which researchers define baselinesâ€™ purpose, scope, concepts, evaluation items, and metrics; baseline implementation is the selection and construction of tools and datasets for evaluation. |
| Baseliner Recruitment            | Baseliner recruitment is the stage at which human baseliners---the humans who respond to evaluation items---are found and are engaged to participate in a baseline.                                                                                                 |
| Baseline Execution               | Baseline execution is the stage at which the human baseline is conducted and result data is collected---e.g., through surveys or crowdwork platforms.                                                                                                               |
| Baseline Analysis                | Baseline analysis is the stage after data collection at which human baseline data is inspected and compared to AI results.                                                                                                                                          |
| Baseline Documentation           | Baseline documentation is the provision of evaluation tasks, datasets, metrics, and experimental materials and resources to relevant audiences.                                                                                                                     |

## Data Availability

Raw data from our literature review of human baselines is available in `/data/lit_review_data.xlsx`.

Summary statistics are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dVXwqi4BjGDC5nf-G1tbJ3lTsrdQbqqnHXHafK1svT8/edit?usp=sharing) (provided as a Google Sheet because Excel broke the formulas).
